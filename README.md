# WeatherPrediction
Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest Methods to Predict Weather in Denpasar, Bali in 2019
●	Developed machine learning models (Decision Trees and Random Forest) to predict weather patterns in Bali.
●	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.
●	Preprocessed data by handling missing values and addressing imbalanced data for improved model accuracy.
●	Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
●	Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, selecting the best model for deployment.
●	Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) and visualized results with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
